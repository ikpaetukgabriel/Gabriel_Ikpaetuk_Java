## Bookstore Inventory Management System
This repository contains a REST API designed to manage inventory for a bookstore. The API supports several user stories, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting authors, publishers, and books from the bookstore's inventory. The API is built using the tried-and-true Spring framework, making the code easy to maintain and extend.

## Swagger Documentation
